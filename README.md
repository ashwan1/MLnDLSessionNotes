# ML and DL Session Notes
I gave training on ML and DL. This repository contains notes from that training as jupyter notebooks.
This session had minimal math required for ML. Then we implement a **predictive keyboard** in variety of ways, starting with very simple model architecture. This develops intutions on ML and DL as to why we should be doing something. 
These jupyter notebooks are for absolute beginners and concepts are explained keeping developers in mind.
